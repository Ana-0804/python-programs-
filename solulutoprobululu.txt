1.  Problem faced while pushing code to git

         [! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
        error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Ana-0804/python-programs-.git'
        hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
        hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
        hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
        hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
        hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.]

SOLUTION :  1. $ git fetch origin main
            2. $ git merge origin main
            3. Now, u can either "git push" or "git commit & git push".
